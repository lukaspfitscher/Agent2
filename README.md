Agent2 is a minimal program that lets an LLM control a terminal


## Introduction
Agent2 is a program that lets a LLM (Large language model) control a linux machine in a terminal.

Agent2 can control a machine by writing bash commands and execute them.
The program will than execute the command and pipe back the output/error to the LLM. Agent2 tries to be minimalistic and only focus on the really essentials things.

To make Agent2 productive for you specific task you need to install CLI tools
and make the agent aware of them in the preprompt.

"A human can do everything with a terminal, therefore, an terminal agent can do it as well"

It is like Claude Code, or Agent Zero but minimalistic.

For that ATK provides a great list of programs and preprompt to make Agent2 productive.
